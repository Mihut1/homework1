# CASE STUDY FOR ROBINHOOD

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
The company is called "Robinhood."

* When was the company incorporated?
Robinhood Markets, Inc. was incorporated in 2013.

* Who are the founders of the company?
The company was founded by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
It's hard getting funding for a startup, but it's even harder when the product doesn't exist yet, still requires regulatory approval, and is being launched during a recession.
Robinhood has been funded through venture capital. Since its inception, the company has raised several rounds of funding, attracting significant interest from investors due to its disruptive business model and rapid growth.

Robinhood had raised over $2 billion in funding. Key investors have included venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Ribbit Capital, among others. 
But after 75 investor pitches, the founders of a commission-free stock-trading app, Robinhood, found a few willing venture capitalists. 


In addition to venture capital, Robinhood's financial journey included an initial public offering (IPO). The company went public on July 29, 2021, under the ticker symbol "HOOD" on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This public offering was another significant step in its funding and provided a new avenue for raising capital while giving the public the opportunity to own a part of the company.


"There were a lot of people who didn't believe in it, and we had to bang down a ton of doors. We were really relentless," Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and co-CEO of Robinhood, told Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell on the "Success! How I Did It" podcast. "We probably knocked on 75 doors before we actually made it work."

In the wide-ranging conversation, Tenev and Shontell discussed:

His move to the United States from Bulgaria as a young boy, and how his upbringing affected his career.
What it was like having about 75 venture-capital doors slammed in his face.
How he and his cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, got nearly 1 million people to sign up for Robinhood before the app even existed.
How they met Snoop Dogg, one of Robinhood's investors.
What it took to build a $1.3 billion company by the age of 30.
What millennials are investing in (the average age of Robinhood's users is 30).

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  Robinhood aims to solve the problem of accessibility and affordability in the stock market for average individuals. Traditionally, stock trading was perceived as complex and expensive, often involving brokerage fees that could deter smaller, retail investors. Robinhood's mission is to democratize finance for all by offering commission-free trading, thereby making financial markets more accessible to a broader segment of the population.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

In the United States alone, millennials and Gen Z constitute a significant portion of the population, with increasing interest in personal finance and investment. Moreover, the trend towards digital solutions in finance suggests a growing market for platforms like Robinhood.
  Unique Solution and Unfair Advantage
Robinhood's primary unique offering is its commission-free trading model. While some competitors have started to offer similar services, Robinhood was among the first and most prominent platforms to do so, which helped it gain a substantial early adopter user base.

Additionally, Robinhood offers a user-friendly and intuitive app design, making it appealing for those new to investing. The simplicity of the platform is a key differentiator, as it lowers the barrier to entry for individuals who might be intimidated by more complex trading platforms.
